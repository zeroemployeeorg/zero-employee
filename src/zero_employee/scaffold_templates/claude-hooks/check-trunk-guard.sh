# PreToolUse hook: deny `git push`, `git merge`, and `git rebase` only when
# (a) the command targets a git repo that is THIS repo (not some other repo
# the session's command happens to `cd`/`-C` into) and (b) the act would land
# on, or is performed while checked out on, the trunk branch there.
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT A PERMISSION GLOB: a glob string-matches the INVOCATION
# ("git push origin main"); this asks git the same question git itself would
# ask before acting - what repo, what branch - rather than pattern-matching
# the command text. A glob can be spelled around by rewording the command;
# this cannot, because it does not care how the command is spelled, only
# what it would actually do.
#
# WHY MERGE/REBASE ARE HERE TOO, NOT JUST PUSH: a blanket permission deny on
# `git merge:*`/`git rebase:*` blocks a stream from merging or rebasing its
# OWN branches, which is normal daily work, not the risk worth denying. The
# risk an outright deny is actually guarding against is narrower than "any
# merge or rebase": `git merge <branch>` while checked out on TRUNK mutates
# trunk's local HEAD directly, no push required for the damage to land
# locally, and even with push separately gated a polluted local trunk
# checkout is wrong for whoever looks at it next. `git rebase` while checked
# out on trunk rewrites trunk's own history locally, same shape. Neither risk
# depends on the branch being MERGED FROM/rebased FROM being someone else's;
# it depends entirely on what's currently checked out. So: gate on "am I on
# trunk right now", not on the command's other arguments - own-branch
# merge/rebase (including merging one feature branch into another) is
# unrestricted.
#
# git reset --hard and rm -rf are DELIBERATELY NOT HERE - those are
# data-loss risks on ANY branch, not a trunk-vs-own-branch question, and
# stay as ordinary permission denies in settings.json rather than becoming
# part of this hook's scope.
